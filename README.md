## Overview

Configurable daemon that provides common features needed on virtual machine instances running in my [hybrid cloud](https://github.com/soerenschneider/soeren.cloud).


## Features

🔑 Sync secrets from Vault<br/>
🏭 Manage x509 and SSH certificates<br/>
📦 Start, stop and restart libvirt domains and systemd units<br/>
📫 Monitor system updates<br/>
🚦 Automatic shutdown, reboot and waking-up of hardware unit<br/>

## Development Workflow

### OpenAPI Spec
Development is done "API first", therefore [server code](internal/adapters/http/api.gen.go) and [client code](pkg/api/api.gen.go) are auto-generated using [oapicodegen](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen) and should not be changed by hand.

The OpenAPI 3 spec file is defined [here](openapi.yaml) and a *swagger* like page is available at the path `/docs` of the API server.

### Generating server and client code

```bash
> make generate
```

### Linting
Linting is done via spectral using the default OpenAPI configuration.

### Detecting API / code configuration drift
A GitHub Actions workflow is in-place that runs code-generation on every commit and fails if the generated code doesn't match the committed code.

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
The default mode is using mTLS to authenticate against the server that serves the REST API. A middleware is available that validates request based on the `CommonName` attribute or `EmailAddresses` attributes of the certificate.

Although strongly discouraged, the server can be configured to run without any authentication for development purposes.

### Authorization
All successfully authenticated users share the same permissions, no distinguished roles are available.


## Components

### K0s
- start K0s service
- stop K0s service

### libvirt
- start a libvirt domain
- shutdown a libvirt domain
- restart a libvirt domain

### packages
- list installed packages on a system
- list updateable packages on a system
- upgrade all packages

### pki
- sign ssh public keys
- get ssh signatures configuration

### secrets
- replicate secrets from Hashicorp Vault to the local system
- get repliaction configuration

### services
- set status of system services (restarted, started, stopped)
- get logs of a system services

### system
- set power status of system (reboot, shutdown)
- get status of conditional-reboot
- set status of conditional-reboot (paused, unpaused)

### Wake-on-Lan

- Send WOL packets to wake up local machines
